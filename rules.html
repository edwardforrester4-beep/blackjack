    <h1>Blackjack Rules</h1>
    <p>Blackjack is a popular card game played in casinos around the world. The
    objective of the game is to have a hand value as close to 21 as possible without
    exceeding it. Here are the basic rules:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Each player is dealt two cards, and the dealer also receives two cards (one face up and one face down).</li>
        <li>Players can choose to "hit" (take another card) or "stand" (keep their current hand).</li>
        <li>If a player's hand exceeds 21, they "bust" and lose the game.</li>
        <li>The dealer must hit until their hand value is 17 or higher.</li>
        <li>If the dealer busts, all remaining players win.</li>
        <li>If neither the player nor the dealer busts, the hand with the higher value wins.</li>
        <li>Aces can be worth 1 or 11, face cards are worth 10, and all other cards are worth their face value.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Good luck and have fun playing Blackjack!</p>
